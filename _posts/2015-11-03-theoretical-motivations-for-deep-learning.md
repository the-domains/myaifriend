description: 'This post is based on the lecture "Deep Learning: Theoretical Motivations" given by Dr. Yoshua Bengio at Deep Learning Summer School, Montreal 2015. I highly recommend the lecture for a deeper understanding of the topic. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning algorithms based on learning multiple levels of representation.'
