    description: "Stephen Hawking will host his first 'Ask Me Anything' session on Reddit on Monday. What's on his mind? Artificial intelligence. Reddit's done it again. Say what you will about the company's internal management issues, but its \"Ask Me Anything\" (AMA) board in the last year has managed to bring in an impressive array of celebrities ready to have their minds picked, from Julian Assange to Tim Berners-Lee to President Obama."

description: "Stephen Hawking is a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author, and all around academic bad ass. There's no doubt in my mind that he's one of the smartest human beings to ever exist. You already knew that though. What you maybe didn't know is that he's incredibly wary of artificial intelligence (AI)."
